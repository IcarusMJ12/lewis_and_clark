Lewis" & "Clark"
=================

A "Cooperative" Game of "Peaceful" "Exploration"
------------------------------------------------

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Expelled for your widely-ridiculed beliefs, you and your fellow adherents have
settled in a new colony on the outskirts of the Tinbrian [#]_ star cluster. As
scholars and gentlerobots, you are driven to explore the galaxy in order to
find evidence for your -- so they say -- "so-called" *Theory of Evolution*.

Design Vision
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*"Lewis" & "Clark"* is, at its heart, a set collection and an engine card game
inspired by *Race for the Galaxy* and *Fairy Tale*. The design goal is to have
a game with the setup time of *Fairy Tale* (no fiddly tokens, only a deck of
cards to shuffle together), a straightforward and concise ruleset that is easy
to pick up, and nuanced player interaction and emergent gameplay that equals or
exceeds that which *Race for the Galaxy* has to offer, all while having a rich,
developed, and exciting theme that both of those games lack [#]_.


Components
~~~~~~~~~~

The game is played solely with a deck of cards. There are four different
card types, identified by the image on the back as well as a matching
border on the front:

-  **gaea** -- a solar system containing at least one planet populated
   by a pseudosapient biological species
-  **remnant** -- a solar system containing at least one planet housing
   the ruins of a more advanced species
-  **barren** -- a relatively uninhabited system that may, however,
   contain alien artifacts or valuable minerals
-  **function** -- a social function at the Royal Xenoresearch
   University of the Far Colonies provides opportunities to schmooze for
   future favors or apply for grants for specialized equipment

Setup
~~~~~

Shuffle the deck and place it face down off to one side of the table.  The deck
is known as **stellae incognitae** and represents the yet-unexplored solar
systems. Deal 5 cards from the deck face down to the side of the deck towards
the center of the table. These are the results from **long-range scanners**.
The players may infer the types of these worlds from the card backs. Further to
the side of the face-down cards is a face-up discard area representing
**published findings**.  Even further is a face-down discard area for consumed
resources. In front of each player is their **hold** -- the tableau to which
they deploy played cards. A player's hand is their **database** of surveyed
worlds and academic functions.

Gameplay
~~~~~~~~

Randomly determine the starting player order. The turns will then resolve
clockwise. During a player's turn they may choose to **survey** by taking two
cards of their choice from **long-range scanners** into their **database** and
putting the top two cards from **stellae incognitae** into **long-range
scanners** as a replacement.  Alternatively, they may play a card from either
their **database** or from **published findings** into their **hold**.

:e.g.: On his first turn *Lewis* has no cards in his hand so he takes the only
       option available to him, which is to **survey**. Of the five cards
       presently in **long-range scanners** two are **functions**.  Deciding
       that getting some prototype hardware will be of greatest benefit in the
       long run *Lewis* decides to snag both **functions** and replaces them
       with with a **remnant** and a **barren** world from the top of **stellae
       incognitae**.

Cards played face-down are counted as **resources** and are free:

-  **gaea** worlds can be **harvested** for **biomass**
-  **remnant** worlds can be **looted** for **weapons**
-  **barren** systems' stars can be **mined** for **hydrogen**
-  University **functions** can be **schmoozed** at for future
   **favors**

Cards played face-up provide benefits as indicated on the card and
usually cost **resources** or require the player to **publish findings**
by discarding appropriate cards.

:e.g.: On his second turn *Lewis* decides to use one of the **functions** to
       **schmooze** for a **favor**, so that on his third turn he can discard
       it to play his remaining card -- *Turbot-class* [#]_ *Vanguard Ship* --
       that provides an additional card draw during **survey** actions. At some
       point later during the game, *Lewis* decides to play the *Wildcard
       Male*.  This is a great **breeding pair** combo with several *Noble
       Savage, Female* cards that *Lewis* already has in play, and well worth
       the cost of one **gaea** world which *Lewis* discards into **published
       findings**.

While some face-up cards directly provide the player with **prestige**
required to win the game, others provide the player with additional
actions they can take during their turn. All actions resolve in the
order of the player's choosing.

:e.g.: *Clark* finally managed to get a hold of and play a couple of
       **functions**.  After performing a **survey** he decides that he wants
       to play one of them immediately. He uses a *Biomass Processor* to treat
       one **biomass** **resource** as a **hydrogen** this turn, and then
       spends this **resource** via a *Fusion Overdrive* to immediately take
       another action of his choice.

.. [#] Tinbria is *totally* not an anagram of Britain.
.. [#] The statement is not intended to disparage these games. They have great
  mechanics, but their themes *are* rather bland and take a second seat to the
  actual gameplay.
.. [#] A *very* fast autonomous ship.
